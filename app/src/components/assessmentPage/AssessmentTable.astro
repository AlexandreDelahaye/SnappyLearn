As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, the following principles are of paramount importance to leaders. First, producing value: does leadership recognize that the production of value over the production of features? Second, encouraging change: does leadership not only welcome change, and not only encourage change, but actually reward change? And third, deliver frequently: does leadership guide the organization to processes conducive to continuous improvement and delivery? Apex’s leadership assessment comprehensively surveys leadership skill in your organization, and it produces recommendations to get leadership on the right track to agility.'
